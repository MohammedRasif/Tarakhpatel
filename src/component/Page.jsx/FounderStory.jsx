            I've spent my career at the intersection of medicine, research, and
            leadership training the next generation of physicians, leading
            radiology departments, and contributing to groundbreaking research
            alongside collaborators who later went on to a Nobel Prize.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base sm:text-lg text-[#B4B4B6]">
            Along the way, I've seen how fragmented health data keeps patients
            from realizing their full health potential. That's why I founded
            Cadensa: to unify wearables, labs, and AI-driven insights into one
            ecosystem for longevity. The goal is to help people live in cadence
            with their health, so they can truly thrive.

            Millions of people wear trackers, get labs, and follow health trends
            - yet still feel uncertain about their long-term health. Fragmented
            tools, generic advice, and disconnected care leave them guessing if
            they're truly on track to age well or unknowingly drifting toward
            disease.
